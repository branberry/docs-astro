Understanding what is a part of an Astro bundle is important for improving site performance. Visualization is often helpful to quickly make sense of what
the bandle contains, and can give clues as to where changes can be made to reduce the bundle size.

## Recipe

<Steps>
1. Install `@rollup/plugin-yaml`:

    <PackageManagerTabs>
        <Fragment slot="npm">
        ```shell
        npm install @rollup/plugin-yaml --save-dev
        ```
        </Fragment>
        <Fragment slot="pnpm">
        ```shell
        pnpm add @rollup/plugin-yaml --save-dev
        ```
        </Fragment>
        <Fragment slot="yarn">
        ```shell
        yarn add @rollup/plugin-yaml --save-dev
        ```
        </Fragment>
    </PackageManagerTabs>
</Steps>
